        <h2>Why I like Neovim</h2>
        <p>I have been using <strong><a href="https://neovim.io" title="Neovim Homepage" target="_blank">Neovim</a></strong> for a almost 2 years and have learned many interesting things about editors that I wouldn't have given a second thought to otherwise. One of the core reasons I went with Neovim over Vim is due to its native <strong>LSP (Language Server Protocol)</strong> support. This standard allows me to use and extend standard Language Servers for commmon languages ranging from <strong>Typscript</strong>, to <strong>lua</strong> which Neovim is configured in, to even <strong>Java</strong> with Eclipse's Language Server. These <strong>Language Servers</strong> Enable everything ranging from <strong>Diagnostics</strong>, <strong>Autocompletion</strong>, <strong>Jump-to-{Definition, Implementation, etc.}</strong>, <strong>Smart Folding</strong>, <strong>Organizing Imports</strong>, <strong>Code Actions</strong>, and many other useful features. The coolest thing about this is that I can develop and tinker with any language from the same core program, each setup with compeditive tooling, and even take my notes for my classes and dev journals. While I understand it won't work with plenty of companies proprietary shenanigans, it is what I have found works best for me when it comes to tinkering, and at least it's not <strong>emacs</strong>.</p>
